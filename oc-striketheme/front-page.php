	<p>OpenCUNY is cared for and nurtured by three student coordinators and a community board. You support their work through the Doctoral Students' Council (DSC), with funds from your <em class="yellow">student activity fee.</em></p>
	<p>In June 2018, Graduate Center administrators re-classified compensation paid to students for DSC work as financial aid. This move places strict limits who is eligible to receive money and how much; demeans student labor; and was imposed without notice or explanation.</p>
	<p>In September 2018, the DSC<span style="color: #ffff00;"> <a style="color: #ffff00;" href="http://cunydsc.org/download/resolutions/2018-2019-Resolutions/20180921_Resolution-Opposing-the-Re-Classification-of-Student-Leadership-Stipends-as-Financial-Aid-or-Assistance.pdf">passed a resolution</a></span> against the administrative action and called for a sustained organized protest. During the protest, and until fair compensation returns, OpenCUNY will continue to be available, but services and events will be limited. Please allow extra time for inquiries.</p>
