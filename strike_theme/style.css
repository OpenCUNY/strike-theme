  <h1><span class="highlight">Compensation</span> isn't aid.</h1>
  <p>OpenCUNY is cared for and nurtured by three student coordinators and a community board. You support their work through the Doctoral Students' Council (DSC), with funds from your <span class="highlight">student activity fee.</span></p>
  <p>In June 2018, Graduate Center administrators re-classified compensation paid to students for DSC work as financial aid. This move places strict limits who is eligible to receive money and how much; demeans student labor; and was imposed without notice or explanation.</p>
  <p>In September 2018, the DSC passed a resolution against the administrative action and called for a sustained organized protest. During the protest, and until fair compensation returns, OpenCUNY will continue to be available, but services and events will be limited. Please allow extra time for inquiries.<p>
